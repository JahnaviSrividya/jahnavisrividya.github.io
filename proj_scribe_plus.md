## A 2D Convolutional Neural Network Approach for Severity Scoring of Lung Tuberculosis using CT Images

**Project description:** To design and implement an efficient, real-time Voice Prescription System that generates formatted prescription from the doctor's dictation to eliminate possible misdiagnosis, resulting from illegible handwriting. An NLP-based system that recognizes patient details (such as name, age,
symptoms, diagnoses, etc.) in the text generated from the doctor's speech input to synthesize the final report, which is then mailed to the patient as an encrypted PDF document.

**Solution:** The patient's information(personal details, symptoms, prognoses, diagnoses, etc) dictated by the doctor is converted into text through Google Cloud Speech-to-Text API. The text output from the API is processed by our trained NLP model to identify the keywords. The report generated from the keywords is mailed to the patient as an encrypted PDF. With the doctor's fingerprint authentication, his/her signature is appended at the end of every report. The data is stored securely in a blockchain network. A doctor can access another doctor's prescription via the respective patient's authorization through OTP.
