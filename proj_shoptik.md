## SHE-FARER - Safe Trip Recommender

**Project description:** This product has been developed for both Corona stricken and the post-pandemic world where hygiene and social distancing will be of utmost concern. Shoptik is a simple solution backed with blockchain to ensure the safety of citizens on their trips to buy essentials and hence lowers the risk factor when they go out

**Solution:** Customers can book a time slot on the day when they decide to go to a shop in their locale, every shop has a hold limit to ensure social distancing while the customers are shopping. The customers then receive a QRcode via email(also accessible via the web-application) that will be scanned on entering the shop premises as well as billing to ensure exit before the time-slot ends. More-over the application lets customers view the availability of essential goods at a shop before booking the slot and the shopkeepers can also tailor their purchase accordingly. The most interesting part of this process is the tracking of people without violating their privacy unlike established apps such as Aarogya Setu, Shoptik allows admins appointed by the government to track the shops that a customer has been to upon being tested positive, and acquire the information of customers who were possibly exposed due to sharing a shopping slot with the carrier.
