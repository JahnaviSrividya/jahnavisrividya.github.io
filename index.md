## Portfolio

I am a woman who loves research and enjoys every second being buried in data. I am very keen on developing my skills and making sure that everything I ever produce is the best of its time. I am great at ideation and problem-solving. Having participated in several prominent hackathons and coming up with top ideas, I want to start my own company one day and convert my research into a real-world product.
